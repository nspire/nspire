NBTC started 15 years ago with the goal of bridging the gap between business and technology that has resulted in others getting swept up in the journey. Since then, we have grown, evolved with the changing Canadian landscape, and have continued to gain <strong>momentum</strong>, moving forward.</p> <p>At NBTC, our goal is to pass this momentum on to our delegates to lead the positive change for the future of business and technology.</p> </div> </div> <div class="conference-right"> <div class="conference-figures"> <div class="conference-figure text-center" ng-repeat="figure in figures"> <h3>{{ figure.number }}</h3> <h4>{{ figure.desc }}</h4> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <a class="slidebutton" slide="up" href="#/" title="Home"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-caret-up fa-2x"></i></a> <a class="slidebutton" slide="left" href="#/sponsors" title="Sponsors"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-caret-left fa-2x"></i></a> <a class="slidebutton" slide="right" href="#/speakers" title="Speakers"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-caret-right fa-2x"></i></a> <a class="slidebutton" slide="down" href="#/gic" title="Global Ideas Case Competition"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-caret-down fa-2x"></i></a>
