I'm fascinated by how easily things can change, but more importantly, by how even the littlest things can make the biggest difference. That being said, I think Attitude makes all the difference. I see the world as a sea of opportunities, and I live my life like a captain steering a ship through uncharted territory. A little scared, yes, but mostly thrilled and with insatiable curiosity! And if I had a motto, it'd be to "Nspire, or be Nspired"... See what I did there? ;)

Learning the term "entrepreneur" and figuring out how to turn that innate drive into a business comes later. I discovered that to be creative is to substantiate your existence in this world and I aim to help others make their mark on the world with cutting edge design and the most modern of development.

She has been working in the area of fundraising, sponsorship, finance and business development since her first year of high school for various non-profits, charities, and most recently, contributing to an Investors Group client base at an existing $60 million in assets under management. Rebecca’s past experiences start from humble beginnings, closing her first sponsorship deal for a whopping $20 Swiss Chalet gift card, to earning the Highest Number of Credit Card Gifts secured for the Richard Ivey School of Business Annual Fund. Rebecca is also a national member of the Canadian junior kungfu team, and a national multiple gold-medalist. She has been a choreographer and performer for various Chinese arts and culture festivals, having been invited by the CEO of GE Canada to perform at the Shanghai World Expo Launch and meeting the Toronto Counsel General of China. Rebecca is often regarded by her colleagues and managers as someone who is "results-oriented", "diligent" and "extremely hard-working". Funnily enough, to contrast this hard-set attitude, Rebecca is a self-admitted "girly girl" who loves the fashion and beauty industry, having worked as a professional makeup artist (during high school) backstage and at SEARS Canada as the youngest Beauty Advsor in the department.
