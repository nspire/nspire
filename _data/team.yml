  bio: "It's hard to decide whether to write this in first or third person. Eccentric and strange are words often used to describe me, when they want to avoid 'weird'. I'm immersed in technology, and I'm magnetically drawn to entrepreneurship. Photography is something I've dabbled in, just enough for it to be more than a hobby. I'm in my third year at the University of Toronto, but you're more likely to find me deeply engaged a &quot;project&quot; than on school work. You probably will never meet someone louder than me; I avoid drinking coffee because I'm naturally on a caffeine high. I'm in love with San Francisco; New York comes in at a close second. Board games suit me better than card games; 72 is my all time favourite number, and I'm a terrible singer. This bio is 144 words long according to WordCounter.net"

Anjali is intrigued by the connection between Healthcare and Technology, and hopes to make a change in Healthcare facilities/programs with the use to innovative technological tools one day. In the past Anjali has been a Human Practice's Lead for iGEM Waterloo where she was able to communicate synthetic biology ideas and processes to students, science enthusiasts and scientists around the world.

#   bio: Hi everyone, I'm Angela. I'll be completing the BBA program at Wilfrid Laurier University in the next year with a specialization in Marketing. I'm fascinated by how easily things can change, but more importantly, by how even the littlest things can make the biggest difference. That being said, I think Attitude makes all the difference. I see the world as a sea of opportunities, and I live my life like a captain steering a ship through uncharted territory. A little scared, yes, but mostly thrilled and with insatiable curiosity! And if I had a motto, it'd be to "Nspire, or be Nspired"... See what I did there? ;)

I don't think very many people start out thinking they are going to be entrepreneurs per se - or at least I didn't. It's about just knowing and feeling that you need to forge your own path and create something of your very own. Learning the term "entrepreneur" and figuring out how to turn that innate drive into a business comes later. I discovered that to be creative is to substantiate your existence in this world and I aim to help others make their mark on the world with cutting edge design and the most modern of development.

She has been working in the area of fundraising, sponsorship, finance and business development since her first year of high school for various non-profits, charities, and most recently, contributing to an Investors Group client base at an existing $60 million in assets under management. Rebecca’s past experiences start from humble beginnings, closing her first sponsorship deal for a whopping $20 Swiss Chalet gift card, to earning the Highest Number of Credit Card Gifts secured for the Richard Ivey School of Business Annual Fund. Rebecca is also a national member of the Canadian junior kungfu team, and a national multiple gold-medalist. She has been a choreographer and performer for various Chinese arts and culture festivals, having been invited by the CEO of GE Canada to perform at the Shanghai World Expo Launch and meeting the Toronto Counsel General of China. Rebecca is often regarded by her colleagues and managers as someone who is "results-oriented", "diligent" and "extremely hard-working". Funnily enough, to contrast this hard-set attitude, Rebecca is a self-admitted "girly girl" who loves the fashion and beauty industry, having worked as a professional makeup artist (during high school) backstage and at SEARS Canada as the youngest Beauty Advsor in the department.  Her favourite animal is a dog for their widely known unconditional love and undying loyalty.
