She has been working in the area of fundraising, sponsorship, finance and business development since her first year of high school for various non-profits, charities, and most recently, contributing to an Investors Group client base at an existing $60 million in assets under management. Rebecca’s past experiences start from humble beginnings, closing her first sponsorship deal for a whopping $20 Swiss Chalet gift card, to earning the Highest Number of Credit Card Gifts secured for the Richard Ivey School of Business Annual Fund. Rebecca is also a national member of the Canadian junior kungfu team, and a national multiple gold-medalist. She has been a choreographer and performer for various Chinese arts and culture festivals, having been invited by the CEO of GE Canada to perform at the Shanghai World Expo Launch and meeting the Toronto Counsel General of China. Rebecca is often regarded by her colleagues and managers as someone who is "results-oriented", "diligent" and "extremely hard-working". Funnily enough, to contrast this hard-set attitude, Rebecca is a self-admitted "girly girl" who loves the fashion and beauty industry, having worked as a professional makeup artist (during high school) backstage and at SEARS Canada as the youngest Beauty Advsor in the department.

  position: VP Finance
  department: Nspire Strategic
  bio: "Jonah is a 2nd year Economics student at the University of Western Ontario with the hopes of earning an HBA from the Ivey Business School. After finishing first year studying Financial Modelling and Computer Science, he realized his passion was and has been finance all along, which has driven almost every extra-curricular involvement he’s been a part of. From being an active member of Western Investment Club and Capital Markets; visiting top finance firms in New York City to an internship at Integral Wealth Securities, a national boutique investment firm, Jonah’s extensive finance experience has culminated in the VP Finance role with Nspire. He is a true believer that money does indeed bring happiness, so long as you don’t spend it on yourself. He wishes to achieve that by creating as much value for business and technology students through Nspire.  Outside of the financial world, Jonah is a brother of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, where he won the annual Airbands dance competition with his pledge class. He is also a slam poet and national ranking sport karate fighter. He is always willing to meet new people, especially those that don’t take everything in life too seriously."

  bio: Hi everyone, I'm Angela. I'll be completing the BBA program at Wilfrid Laurier University in the next year with a specialization in Marketing. I'm fascinated by how easily things can change, but more importantly, by how even the littlest things can make the biggest difference. That being said, I think Attitude makes all the difference. I see the world as a sea of opportunities, and I live my life like a captain steering a ship through uncharted territory. A little scared, yes, but mostly thrilled and with insatiable curiosity! And if I had a motto, it'd be to "Nspire, or be Nspired"... See what I did there? ;)
