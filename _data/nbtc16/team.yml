When he's not tearing out his hair over bugs in his code, he's working towards being less awful at graphic design, photography, and the ukulele. Above all, he's passionate about making the \"biztech\" space a bit more digestible for students like himself, which is why he's on this year's NBTC team. He's looking forward to making a great conference for great people. Jack is also involved in Canada's debate circuit and will be competing in Greece this year at the World Universities Debating Championship (he's a lot more nervous about it than he lets on). If you see him without tea or coffee, please contact his doctor immediately. "

He is extremely thrilled to be joining Accenture as a full-time Management Consulting Analyst. Before his life becomes an endless grind, Michael encourages everyone in the nonprofit or startup space to reach out to him. He would love to help!"
