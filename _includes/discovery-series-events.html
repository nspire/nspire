		<p class="lead">What is Growth Hacking?</p>
		<p>“Growth Hacking” is a hot term among start-ups since growth is key to success. A growth hacker uses their product knowledge to create high-impact marketing strategies, and ultimately, grow a business. In other words, they are “hacking growth”.</p>
		<p class="lead">"But I'm not a hacker..."</p>
		<p>Many of you are probably growth hacking without realizing it. Do you use social media? Have your own blog? Know how to make videos? These are only a few examples of growth hacking techniques that have been used by many familiar start-ups like Facebook, YouTube, and Dropbox to acquire users or drive engagement.</p>
