					<p>Nspire originated from the visionary eagerness of University students who wanted to bridge the gap between business and technology through the creation of the National Business and Technology Conference (NBTC) in 2001. Today, Nspire’s flame is fueled by brilliant and passionate student leaders, which have made Nspire a key component in building that bridge. Nspire breathes solely to connect, empower and inspire its members into a future of personal success. Its vision is to foster Canada’s next generation of innovative CEO’s, founders and leaders in the business and technology space.</p>
					<p>Ever since its humble beginnings, Nspire has brought together its members with some of the most innovative business leaders, such as Sean O’Dea, Founder of Second Cup, Sean Wise, industry advisor to CBC’s hit show Dragon’s Den, and Anthony Lacavera, Chairman and CEO of Globalive Communications Corp. From then on, the organization has introduced various new initiatives such as the Entrepreneurship Competition in 2007, which lead students to start companies such as Dreamcube Technologies and Shape Collage Inc.</p>
					<p>In 2009, after many successful years with NBTC, and the creation of new initiatives, Nspire was created as the organization that would unify all these endeavors under one brand.</p>
